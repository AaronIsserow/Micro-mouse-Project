This project develops the sensing part of a micro-mouse robot that's meant to move through mazes on its own. The main job of this subsystem is to help the robot spot obstacles, which lets it make quick decisions to find its way to the end of the maze efficiently. We're working on both the hardware and software needed to detect obstacles and guide the robot.

The importance of this project lies in its role in the robot's ability to navigate by itself. By figuring out where obstacles are, the robot can understand its surroundings better. This not only helps our micro-mouse work but also gives us insights into how autonomous robots can be built and improved. It's especially useful for learning about how robots can use sensors to interact with their environment.
