This project develops the sensing part of a micro-mouse robot that's meant to move through mazes on its own. The main job of this subsystem is to help the robot spot obstacles, which lets it make quick decisions to find its way to the end of the maze efficiently. I will be working on both the hardware and software needed to detect obstacles and guide the robot.

The importance of this project lies in its role in the robot's ability to navigate by itself using IR light. By figuring out where obstacles are, the robot can understand its surroundings better. 

This project is looked after by me, Aaron Isserow, with help from another student, Emanuele Vichi. We're always open to new ideas and improvements, so feel free to chip in if you're interested in making the project better.
