# Micro-Mouse Power Subsystem
This repository contains the design and documentation for the power subsystem of a functional micro-mouse, a maze-solving robot. The project focuses on designing and manufacturing a power module that meets the specific requirements outlined in the project brief.

## Project Overview
The micro-mouse project involves the development, testing, and operation of a fully assembled and functioning maze-solving robot. This robot is designed to autonomously navigate through a maze environment. The power subsystem is one of several subsystems that make up the micro-mouse, and it is responsible for distributing power from the battery source to the rest of the system.

## Scope
The scope of this project includes:

- Designing and manufacturing a power module that adheres to the project requirements.
- Distributing power from the battery source to the motors and other components.
- Designing the module to accommodate charging from an external source.
- Ensuring the power module fits within the physical constraints of the micro-mouse.
- Testing the power module thoroughly before integration with the rest of the system.

## Project Focus
This repository specifically focuses on documenting the design of the power subsystem.

## Repository Structure
- Datasheets: Contains the datasheets of all the ICs used.
- KiCAD Design: Contains files related to the design of the circuit diagram and printed circuit board for the power module.
- Production Files: Contains all production files required to order the PCB from JLCPCB
