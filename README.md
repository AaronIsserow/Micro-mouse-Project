# Micro-mouse Project
This project consists of designing an autonomous maze solving robot. This robot is designed to autonomously navigate through a maze environment.
This repository contains the designs of the following two subsystems that are part of the micro-mouse system:
- The power subsystem
- The sensing subsystem

## Micro-Mouse Power Subsystem
The design and documentation for the power subsystem of a functional micro-mouse is provided. The project focuses on designing and manufacturing a power module that meets the specific requirements outlined in the project brief.
The power subsystem is one of several subsystems that make up the micro-mouse, and it is responsible for distributing power from the battery source to the rest of the system.

### Scope
The scope of this project includes:

- Designing and manufacturing a power module that adheres to the project requirements.
- Distributing power from the battery source to the motors and other components.
- Designing the module to accommodate charging from an external source.
- Ensuring the power module fits within the physical constraints of the micro-mouse.
- Testing the power module thoroughly before integration with the rest of the system.
